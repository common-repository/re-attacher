== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed the plugin, but the attachment button did not appear in the gallery. Why? =

== Can I use this plugin for custom post types? ==

Yes, when attaching files from the media library, you will see all post types in the list of available posts.

Once the "Select Files" windo appears, please hold down Shift or Ctrl key, and select the files you want to attach.
